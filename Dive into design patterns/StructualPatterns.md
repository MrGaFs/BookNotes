## Adapter Design Pattern aka wrapper

### What is Adapter Design Pattern ?

Adapter design pattern is a design pattern that allows classes to work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

### When to use it

- Iamgine that we use and API that is uses json format to use it and We work with XML format, then we will need to use Adapter design pattern, because we need to convert XML format to JSON format.

- Use the Adapter class when you want to use some existing class, but its interface isn’t compatible with the rest of your code.

- Use the pattern when you want to reuse several existing subclasses that lack some common functionality that can’t be added to the superclass.

### adapter design pattern UML

#### object adapter

![adapter design pattern](./UMLs/structualPatterns/object-adapter.png)

#### Class Adapter (only supported in language that suppoerts multiple inheritance like c++)

![adapter design pattern](./UMLs/structualPatterns/class-adapter.png)

### How to implement Adapter design pattern?

1. Make sure that you have at least two classes with incompatible interfaces:

   - A useful service class, which you can’t change (often 3rd-party, legacy or with lots of existing dependencies).

   - One or several client classes that would benefit from using the service class.
Declare the client interface and describe how clients communicate with the service.

1. Create the adapter class and make it follow the client interface. Leave all the methods empty for now.

1. Add a field to the adapter class to store a reference to the service object. The common practice is to initialize this field via the constructor, but sometimes it’s more convenient to pass it to the adapter when calling its methods.

1. One by one, implement all methods of the client interface in the adapter class. The adapter should delegate most of the real work to the service object, handling only the interface or data format conversion.

1. Clients should use the adapter via the client interface. This will let you change or extend the adapters without affecting the client code

### code sample for adapter design pattern

```ts
/**
 * The Target defines the domain-specific interface used by the client code.
 */
class Target {
    public request(): string {
        return 'Target: The default target\'s behavior.';
    }
}

/**
 * The Adaptee contains some useful behavior, but its interface is incompatible
 * with the existing client code. The Adaptee needs some adaptation before the
 * client code can use it.
 */
class Adaptee {
    public specificRequest(): string {
        return '.eetpadA eht fo roivaheb laicepS';
    }
}

/**
 * The Adapter makes the Adaptee's interface compatible with the Target's
 * interface.
 */
class Adapter extends Target {
    private adaptee: Adaptee;

    constructor(adaptee: Adaptee) {
        super();
        this.adaptee = adaptee;
    }

    public request(): string {
        const result = this.adaptee.specificRequest().split('').reverse().join('');
        return `Adapter: (TRANSLATED) ${result}`;
    }
}

/**
 * The client code supports all classes that follow the Target interface.
 */
function clientCode(target: Target) {
    console.log(target.request());
}

console.log('Client: I can work just fine with the Target objects:');
const target = new Target();
clientCode(target);

console.log('');

const adaptee = new Adaptee();
console.log('Client: The Adaptee class has a weird interface. See, I don\'t understand it:');
console.log(`Adaptee: ${adaptee.specificRequest()}`);

console.log('');

console.log('Client: But I can work with it via the Adapter:');
const adapter = new Adapter(adaptee);
clientCode(adapter);
```

## Bridge Design Pattern

### What is Bridge Desitgn Pattern?

**Bridge** is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

### When to use bridge design pattern ?

- Use the Bridge pattern when you want to divide and organize a monolithic class that has several variants of some functionality (for example, if the class can work with various database servers).

- Use the pattern when you need to extend a class in several orthogonal (independent) dimensions.

- Use the Bridge if you need to be able to switch implementations at runtime.

### Bridge design pattern UML

![bridge design pattern](./UMLs/structualPatterns/bridge.png)

### how to implement Bridge design pattern?

1. Identify the orthogonal dimensions in your classes. These independent concepts could be: abstraction/platform, domain/infrastructure, front-end/back-end, or interface/implementation.

1. See what operations the client needs and define them in the base abstraction class.

1. Determine the operations available on all platforms. Declare the ones that the abstraction needs in the general implementation interface.

1. For all platforms in your domain create concrete implementation classes, but make sure they all follow the implementation interface.

1. Inside the abstraction class, add a reference field for the implementation type. The abstraction delegates most of the work to the implementation object that’s referenced in that field.

1. If you have several variants of high-level logic, create refined abstractions for each variant by extending the base abstraction class.

1. The client code should pass an implementation object to the abstraction’s constructor to associate one with the other. After that, the client can forget about the implementation and work only with the abstraction object.

### code sample of bridge design pattern

```ts
/**
 * The Abstraction defines the interface for the "control" part of the two class
 * hierarchies. It maintains a reference to an object of the Implementation
 * hierarchy and delegates all of the real work to this object.
 */
class Abstraction {
    protected implementation: Implementation;

    constructor(implementation: Implementation) {
        this.implementation = implementation;
    }

    public operation(): string {
        const result = this.implementation.operationImplementation();
        return `Abstraction: Base operation with:\n${result}`;
    }
}

/**
 * You can extend the Abstraction without changing the Implementation classes.
 */
class ExtendedAbstraction extends Abstraction {
    public operation(): string {
        const result = this.implementation.operationImplementation();
        return `ExtendedAbstraction: Extended operation with:\n${result}`;
    }
}

/**
 * The Implementation defines the interface for all implementation classes. It
 * doesn't have to match the Abstraction's interface. In fact, the two
 * interfaces can be entirely different. Typically the Implementation interface
 * provides only primitive operations, while the Abstraction defines higher-
 * level operations based on those primitives.
 */
interface Implementation {
    operationImplementation(): string;
}

/**
 * Each Concrete Implementation corresponds to a specific platform and
 * implements the Implementation interface using that platform's API.
 */
class ConcreteImplementationA implements Implementation {
    public operationImplementation(): string {
        return 'ConcreteImplementationA: Here\'s the result on the platform A.';
    }
}

class ConcreteImplementationB implements Implementation {
    public operationImplementation(): string {
        return 'ConcreteImplementationB: Here\'s the result on the platform B.';
    }
}

/**
 * Except for the initialization phase, where an Abstraction object gets linked
 * with a specific Implementation object, the client code should only depend on
 * the Abstraction class. This way the client code can support any abstraction-
 * implementation combination.
 */
function clientCode(abstraction: Abstraction) {
    // ..

    console.log(abstraction.operation());

    // ..
}

/**
 * The client code should be able to work with any pre-configured abstraction-
 * implementation combination.
 */
let implementation = new ConcreteImplementationA();
let abstraction = new Abstraction(implementation);
clientCode(abstraction);

console.log('');

implementation = new ConcreteImplementationB();
abstraction = new ExtendedAbstraction(implementation);
clientCode(abstraction);
```

## Composite Design Pattern aka (object tree)

### what is composite design pattern?

it's self explaintory to me It's a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, like tree data structure.

### composite design pattern UML

![composite design pattern](./UMLs/structualPatterns/composite.png)

### code sample for composite design pattern

```ts
/**
 * The base Component class declares common operations for both simple and
 * complex objects of a composition.
 */
abstract class Component {
    protected parent: Component;

    /**
     * Optionally, the base Component can declare an interface for setting and
     * accessing a parent of the component in a tree structure. It can also
     * provide some default implementation for these methods.
     */
    public setParent(parent: Component) {
        this.parent = parent;
    }

    public getParent(): Component {
        return this.parent;
    }

    /**
     * In some cases, it would be beneficial to define the child-management
     * operations right in the base Component class. This way, you won't need to
     * expose any concrete component classes to the client code, even during the
     * object tree assembly. The downside is that these methods will be empty
     * for the leaf-level components.
     */
    public add(component: Component): void { }

    public remove(component: Component): void { }

    /**
     * You can provide a method that lets the client code figure out whether a
     * component can bear children.
     */
    public isComposite(): boolean {
        return false;
    }

    /**
     * The base Component may implement some default behavior or leave it to
     * concrete classes (by declaring the method containing the behavior as
     * "abstract").
     */
    public abstract operation(): string;
}

/**
 * The Leaf class represents the end objects of a composition. A leaf can't have
 * any children.
 *
 * Usually, it's the Leaf objects that do the actual work, whereas Composite
 * objects only delegate to their sub-components.
 */
class Leaf extends Component {
    public operation(): string {
        return 'Leaf';
    }
}

/**
 * The Composite class represents the complex components that may have children.
 * Usually, the Composite objects delegate the actual work to their children and
 * then "sum-up" the result.
 */
class Composite extends Component {
    protected children: Component[] = [];

    /**
     * A composite object can add or remove other components (both simple or
     * complex) to or from its child list.
     */
    public add(component: Component): void {
        this.children.push(component);
        component.setParent(this);
    }

    public remove(component: Component): void {
        const componentIndex = this.children.indexOf(component);
        this.children.splice(componentIndex, 1);

        component.setParent(null);
    }

    public isComposite(): boolean {
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * The Composite executes its primary logic in a particular way. It
     * traverses recursively through all its children, collecting and summing
     * their results. Since the composite's children pass these calls to their
     * children and so forth, the whole object tree is traversed as a result.
     */
    public operation(): string {
        const results = [];
        for (const child of this.children) {
            results.push(child.operation());
        }

        return `Branch(${results.join('+')})`;
    }
}

/**
 * The client code works with all of the components via the base interface.
 */
function clientCode(component: Component) {
    // ...

    console.log(`RESULT: ${component.operation()}`);

    // ...

/**
 * This way the client code can support the simple leaf components...
 */
const simple = new Leaf();
console.log('Client: I\'ve got a simple component:');
clientCode(simple);
console.log('');

/**
 * ...as well as the complex composites.
 */
const tree = new Composite();

branch1.add(new Leaf());
const branch2 = new Composite();
branch2.add(new Leaf());
tree.add(branch1);
tree.add(branch2);
console.log('Client: Now I\'ve got a composite tree:');
clientCode(tree);
console.log('');

/**
 * Thanks to the fact that the child-management operations are declared in the
 * base Component class, the client code can work with any component, simple or
 * complex, without depending on their concrete classes.
 */
function clientCode2(component1: Component, component2: Component) {
    // ...

```

## Decorator Design pattern

### what is decorator design pattern?

Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

### When to use decorator design pattern?

- Use the Decorator pattern when you need to be able to assign extra behaviors to objects at runtime without breaking the code that uses these objects.

- Use the pattern when it’s awkward or not possible to extend an object’s behavior using inheritance.

### decorator design pattern UML

![decorator design pattern](./UMLs/structualPatterns/Decorator.png)

### code sample of Decorator pattern

```ts
/**
 * The base Component interface defines operations that can be altered by
 * decorators.
 */
interface Component {
    operation(): string;
}

/**
 * Concrete Components provide default implementations of the operations. There
 * might be several variations of these classes.
 */
class ConcreteComponent implements Component {
    public operation(): string {
        return 'ConcreteComponent';
    }
}

/**
 * The base Decorator class follows the same interface as the other components.
 * The primary purpose of this class is to define the wrapping interface for all
 * concrete decorators. The default implementation of the wrapping code might
 * include a field for storing a wrapped component and the means to initialize
 * it.
 */
class Decorator implements Component {
    protected component: Component;

    constructor(component: Component) {
        this.component = component;
    }

    /**
     * The Decorator delegates all work to the wrapped component.
     */
    public operation(): string {
        return this.component.operation();
    }
}

/**
 * Concrete Decorators call the wrapped object and alter its result in some way.
 */
class ConcreteDecoratorA extends Decorator {
    /**
     * Decorators may call parent implementation of the operation, instead of
     * calling the wrapped object directly. This approach simplifies extension
     * of decorator classes.
     */
    public operation(): string {
        return `ConcreteDecoratorA(${super.operation()})`;
    }
}

/**
 * Decorators can execute their behavior either before or after the call to a
 * wrapped object.
 */
class ConcreteDecoratorB extends Decorator {
    public operation(): string {
        return `ConcreteDecoratorB(${super.operation()})`;
    }
}

/**
 * The client code works with all objects using the Component interface. This
 * way it can stay independent of the concrete classes of components it works
 * with.
 */
function clientCode(component: Component) {
    // ...

    console.log(`RESULT: ${component.operation()}`);

    // ...
}

/**
 * This way the client code can support both simple components...
 */
const simple = new ConcreteComponent();
console.log('Client: I\'ve got a simple component:');
clientCode(simple);
console.log('');

/**
 * ...as well as decorated ones.
 *
 * Note how decorators can wrap not only simple components but the other
 * decorators as well.
 */
const decorator1 = new ConcreteDecoratorA(simple);
const decorator2 = new ConcreteDecoratorB(decorator1);
console.log('Client: Now I\'ve got a decorated component:');
clientCode(decorator2);
```

## Facade Design pattern

### What is facade design pattern?

let's imagine that we have a complex system with many classes and many method, or a library with ton of functions like ffmpeg and I wanna use only a few or one feature from it.  
this will make the code very hard to read and maintain.  
so we make facade class which will be the only class that will be used by the user, and it will handle this library and make it easy to use.

(**scientific defintion**) Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

### facade design pattern uml

![facade](./UMLs/structualPatterns/facade.png)

### code sample of facade design pattern

```ts
/**
 * The Facade class provides a simple interface to the complex logic of one or
 * several subsystems. The Facade delegates the client requests to the
 * appropriate objects within the subsystem. The Facade is also responsible for
 * managing their lifecycle. All of this shields the client from the undesired
 * complexity of the subsystem.
 */
class Facade {
    protected subsystem1: Subsystem1;

    protected subsystem2: Subsystem2;

    /**
     * Depending on your application's needs, you can provide the Facade with
     * existing subsystem objects or force the Facade to create them on its own.
     */
    constructor(subsystem1: Subsystem1 = null, subsystem2: Subsystem2 = null) {
        this.subsystem1 = subsystem1 || new Subsystem1();
        this.subsystem2 = subsystem2 || new Subsystem2();
    }

    /**
     * The Facade's methods are convenient shortcuts to the sophisticated
     * functionality of the subsystems. However, clients get only to a fraction
     * of a subsystem's capabilities.
     */
    public operation(): string {
        let result = 'Facade initializes subsystems:\n';
        result += this.subsystem1.operation1();
        result += this.subsystem2.operation1();
        result += 'Facade orders subsystems to perform the action:\n';
        result += this.subsystem1.operationN();
        result += this.subsystem2.operationZ();

        return result;
    }
}

/**
 * The Subsystem can accept requests either from the facade or client directly.
 * In any case, to the Subsystem, the Facade is yet another client, and it's not
 * a part of the Subsystem.
 */
class Subsystem1 {
    public operation1(): string {
        return 'Subsystem1: Ready!\n';
    }

    // ...

    public operationN(): string {
        return 'Subsystem1: Go!\n';
    }
}

/**
 * Some facades can work with multiple subsystems at the same time.
 */
class Subsystem2 {
    public operation1(): string {
        return 'Subsystem2: Get ready!\n';
    }

    // ...

    public operationZ(): string {
        return 'Subsystem2: Fire!';
    }
}

/**
 * The client code works with complex subsystems through a simple interface
 * provided by the Facade. When a facade manages the lifecycle of the subsystem,
 * the client might not even know about the existence of the subsystem. This
 * approach lets you keep the complexity under control.
 */
function clientCode(facade: Facade) {
    // ...

    console.log(facade.operation());

    // ...
}

/**
 * The client code may have some of the subsystem's objects already created. In
 * this case, it might be worthwhile to initialize the Facade with these objects
 * instead of letting the Facade create new instances.
 */
const subsystem1 = new Subsystem1();
const subsystem2 = new Subsystem2();
const facade = new Facade(subsystem1, subsystem2);
clientCode(facade);

## flyweight design pattern (RAM Saver) aka cache

### What is flyweight design pattern?

**Flyweight** is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.

it's saimilar to prototype in js and ts

## proxy design pattern

Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

/**
 * The RealSubject contains some core business logic. Usually, RealSubjects are
